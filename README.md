# Odin Recipes
The "Odin Recipes" repository, where I showcase my fundamental knowledge of HTML through creating webpages for certain food recipes.
This is my project from The Odin Project here: [https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes)

## Features

- **Structured HTML:** Organised HTML code is the foundation of these pages. Headers, paragraphs, lists, etc are used throughout.

- **Recipe Pages:** Each recipe has it's own dedicated page to showcase a description, prep and cooking time, ingredients, and the steps to create it.

- **Navigation:** Hyperlinks used throughout to link multiple pages together from the homepage.
